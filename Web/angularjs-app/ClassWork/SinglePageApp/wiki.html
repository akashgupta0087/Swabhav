            India (official name: the Republic of India;[19] Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya) is a country in South Asia. It is
            the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in
            the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal
            on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[d] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the
            north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka
            and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

            Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[20] Their long
            occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
            second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[21] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the
            western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley
            Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[22] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European
            language, had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and
            recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[23] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the
            northern regions.[24] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[25] and
            Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[26] Early political
            consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[27] Their
            collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[28] but also marked by the declining status of
            women,[29] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organized system of belief.[e][30] In south
            India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of
            southeast Asia.[31]

            In the early medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Islam put down roots on India's
            southern and western coasts.[32] Armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's plains,[33]
            eventually establishing the Delhi sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of
            medieval Islam.[34] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu
            culture in south India.[35] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalized religion.[36] The
            Mughal empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[37] leaving a legacy of luminous
            architecture.[f][38] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into
            a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[39] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights
            promised to Indians were granted slowly,[40] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of
            education, modernity and the public life took root.[41] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement
            emerged,[42] which was noted for nonviolent resistance and led India to its independence in 1947.

            India is a secular federal republic governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic,
            multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1,211 million in
            2011.[43] During the same time, its nominal per capita income, increased from $64 annually to $2,041, and
            its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[44] India has
            become a fast-growing major economy, a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle
            class.[45] It has a space program which includes several planned or completed lunar missions. Indian movies,
            music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[46] India has substantially
            reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[47] India is a nuclear
            weapons state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbors,
            Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[48] Among the socioeconomic challenges India
            faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[49] and rising levels of air pollution.[50] India's land is
            megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[51] Its forest cover comprises 21.4% of its area.[52] India's
            wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[53] is supported among
            these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.

            By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from
            Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[63][64][65] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia
            date to about 30,000 years ago.[66] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals,
            construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other
            sites in what is now Balochistan.[67] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[68][67]
            the first urban culture in South Asia,[69] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and
            western India.[70] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and
            relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilization engaged robustly in crafts production and
            wide-ranging trade.[69]

            During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures
            to the Iron Age ones.[71] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[72] were composed
            during this period,[73] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and
            the upper Gangetic Plain.[71] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of
            Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[72] The caste system, which created a
            hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their
            occupations impure, arose during this period.[74] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this
            period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[71] In South India, a
            progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this
            period,[75] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[75] File:

            Career is defined as 'A particular occupation for which one is trained'. We understand it's far-reaching
            impact and it's scope, even more, better, than we have ever realised. This scenario wasn't evident in
            ancient times, nobody cared about career, everybody was happy with whatever profession they were pursuing.
            Industrialisation and the growth of education in the global economy, made us realise the importance of
            career and how one can plan a career.

            The importance of choosing the right career is the most complicated one. There are professions which are 'In
            Demand' and those which are 'Not in Demand'. These 'In Demand' professions are lucrative and their opposing
            counterpart isn't. Here, it becomes easy for one to choose a career which is obvious - 'In Demand' ones. For
            most of us, money matters the most when it comes to pursuing a career. However, some of us are passionate
            about what we do and we follow our instincts rather than our convictions. And, there are some who will curb
            their aspired desires to follow those which provide more money in the pocket. Such professionals might not
            become as successful as they should be, they might not be as efficient as their job requires them to be and
            even if they achieve success, it is achieved at the cost of their real aspirations. Then there are those of
            us who are in a state of confusion, which careers to choose? who to look for guidance and information. It is
            here that our role comes into place, as the foremost objective of this section is based on guiding you in
            the best possible way and the cheapest too!
